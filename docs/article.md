WIP Article / Still mostly a brain dump => Congress needs to be able to hold Votes online

# Define The Problem

## Describe the problem
While the entire nation is currently trying to stay six feet apart and reduce face to face interactions as much as possible to slow the spread of Covid19 our Congress is hard at work trying to pass legislation to keep our society from collapsing.

## Describe why the problem is a big deal
Unfortunately, for some archaic reason The United States Congress is meeting and voting in person. With an average age of nearly 63 in the US Senate we're putting the leaders of our nation, and a critical group that's required to push forward nation saving legislation at risk. It's not unreasonable to think that our government is at an unacceptable risk of becoming dysfunction because of the affects Covid19 could place on either the Senate and House of Representatives.
If either or both branches of congress can no longer meet, and they still don't have a system to hold remote votes our nation could be in a place where it can no longer react to the realities that this pandemic is placing on our country.

# Explain the project
Luckily, we actually already have proven solutions to make remote voting for groups like The United States Congress secure, and transparent. Unfortunately, these solutions heavily rely on technology and computer science concepts. Which are topics our congress tends to have a low level of understand of.

In this article I'll attempt to explain a possible solution for a remote voting system that could be used by Congress to hold votes securely and transparently using proven technologies, and I'll then explain how those technologies are used in a proof of concept system I've already developed.

## Describe the high level technical problems
The most obvious problem faced when designing a remote voting system for a body like congress is that you want to know you're able to trust the results of the vote. In other words, we don't want people to be able to hack votes taking place in Congress.

There are three key points we need to make sure we cover in our design of this remote voting system in order to setup a system where we can be confident that we can track who voted which way, and that their votes haven't been tampered with.

A. If a Senator or Representative is voting from an Internet connected device we want to be sure that we have no doubts that the vote came from the member of congress, and nobody else.
B. We need to know that the way the member of congress voted hasn't been changed in any way.
C. That storage of that voting data must be permanent, and immutable. Or in other words. We must be sure that data cannot be changed.

## Describe the existing technology that can be used to solve it
We can use some proven technology to design a system that meets those three points.

To ensure we know we can trust that the person making votes is who they claim to be we can use what's called Asymmetric Encryption. Asymmetric Encryption will allow our system to have the members of congress digitally sign their votes using a public private key pair. The member of congress will have an internet connected device that contains two complicated keys. One that is known publicly which can be used to identify the member of congress, and a private key never leaves their device, and never travels on a network.
Their private key only exists on their device to generate a "signature". The signature is a known value that is encrypted using the private key. If someone knows the public key, and the encrypted message they can decrypt the signature using the publicly known public key, and prove that the signature must have been generated by the member of congress' private key. Thus, ensuring that the vote attached to the signature is indeed from that member of congress.

In addition to knowing that a vote originated from the person the vote is claim to have come from, we also want to be sure that the vote is never tampered with or edited. To do that we can use what's called Hash function in conjunction with the Asymmetric Encryption signature to generate not just a signature that proves who created the vote, but that the content of the vote hasn't been changed.
A hash function is a one way mathematical formula that given the same data will always produce the same result, but you can't produce that data from the outputted result from the hash function. What is most important is that if the input into the hash function is changed even slightly the result will be different. So, we can generate a hash of the digital content of a member's vote, and keep track of the hash. If the member's vote ever doesn't match the hash we know that something was changed. Remember how the Asymmetrical Encryption signature needed a message to be encrypted with the private key. What we can do is make that message that is encrypted the hash value of the vote's digital content.
That would mean if we can validate the signature using the vote content's hash, and the public key of the member of congress placing the vote we'd know that the member of congress did infact place that vote, and that the vote hasn't been tampered with.

Finally, we need to ensure once the vote is placed that it never gets lost or modified. If you're familiar with the concept of Bitcoin there is a technology that Bitcoin runs on top of. It's called Blockchain, and in our solution for remote congress voting we'll be storing votes made by members of congress in a Blockchain. We're doing that for a few reasons, but the biggest reason is that the data stored in a Blockchain is immutable and distributed. So we can be pretty confident that the data of congressional votes will never change once it's stored and because the system is stored in a distributed way we can be pretty sure the content will never be deleted.

## Describe the proof of concept that has been built
With those three design concepts we should be able to setup a system that can track votes and ensure the content is valid, untampered with, and comes from who it claims, and I've done just [that](https://github.com/nathanmentley/RemoteCongress).
It's an open source proof of concept, and isn't read to be run in a production setting, but it proves the using these technologies together can result in a functional system that we can trust to handle congressional voting.

The project has a two parts:
* There is a client app that mimics what each member of congress would run on their local internet connected device. That tool will generate votes, sign them, and send them automatically.
* There is a server that the client app will send votes to, this server will validate the votes, and store them in an immutable blockchain data store. Additionally the server can return votes that have already been cast, and again it'll validate those votes before returning them to ensure the votes are still untampered with.

## Describe what isn't solved, and define the assumptions we're making.
There are a few limitations with this system, and I've designed it with a few assumptions that do prevent a few use cases from being possible. The way each individual votes will be publicly known. Based on how the signatures work, and the need to know who each public key belongs to there isn't a way to support anonymous votes. While this works great for congress where transparency is key, that means we'd never be able to use this system in public elections.
